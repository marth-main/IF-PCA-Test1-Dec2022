# IF-PCA-Test1-Dec2022
PCA and Isolation forest applied to x-ray images to identify outliers

Identifies white-out images ok
Misses most distorted images with more black colour as opposed to white/gray

Removed scaling?

Finished attempt 1


Need to add:
- use filenames from outlier df to grab those files and move into a new folder to manually check
